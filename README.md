# Pointers
Pointers are addresses of memories that points to a variable which stores data. <br>
//---create pointers                              <br>
int k=5;                                          <br>
int *pk=k; // (create pointers, pk points to k)   <br>
  //--Memory Diagram                              <br>
  |5| <- ||                                       <br>
  k      pk                                       <br>
  //--Memory Diagram--                            <br>
  //-explanation                                  <br>
   a pointer pk pointing to k is created , pk stores the address of k ,   <br> 
   since k  is  initialised to 5, pointer pk whenever called will go to k, and grab whatever k is currently = to;   <br>
