# Pointers
Pointers are addresses of memories that points to a variable which stores data.
//---create pointers 
int k=5;
int *pk=k; // (create pointers, pk points to k)
  //--Memory Diagram
  |5| <- ||
  k      pk
  //--Memory Diagram--
  //-explanation
   a pointer pk pointing to k is created , pk stores the address of k , 
   since k  is  initialised to 5, pointer pk whenever called will go to k, and grab whatever k is currently = to;
